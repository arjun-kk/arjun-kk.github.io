# Research

I work on issues at the intersection of AI, cognitive science and natural sciences. My dissertation focuses on the notion of cognitive maps and world models in general. In this page, you will find my works in progress and published papers.

# Works in Progress

I am currently thinking about what representational similarity analysis can tell us about how our minds encode information. I have a paper in progress on the issue.
